# Portfolio Website Roadmap

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Choose a design system or framework (e.g., Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, or custom CSS).
- [ ] Create a basic file structure:
  - `/index.html` (homepage)
  - `/projects.html` (projects page)
  - `/styles/` (CSS files)
  - `/images/` (for icons and project thumbnails)

## Phase 2: Hero Section
- [ ] Design a clean hero section with:
  - Your name and professional tagline.
  - A short bio or introduction.
  - A call to action (e.g., "View My Work" button).
  - Social media icons for GitHub and LinkedIn.
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views.

## Phase 3: Skills Section
- [ ] Create a skills section showing:
  - Icons or short labels of your key skills (front-end, back-end, databases, etc.).
  - Add a short timeline or bullet points summarizing your experience.
- [ ] Ensure the section has consistent typography and spacing.

## Phase 4: Projects Section
- [ ] Highlight 1-3 key projects:
  - Each project should have a thumbnail or visual element.
  - Include a brief description (tech used, what you built, challenges solved).
  - Link each project to its detailed page or external site (GitHub, live demo, etc.).
- [ ] Add a “See All Projects” button linking to the dedicated projects page.

## Phase 5: Footer

- [ ] Ensure the footer is visible across all pages.

## Phase 6: Projects Page
- [ ] Build a dedicated projects page that lists all projects.
- [ ] Include relevant info for each project (description, tech stack, links to live demos or GitHub).
  
## Phase 7: Final Touches
- [ ] Implement hover effects for buttons and icons (e.g., change color or scale on hover).
- [ ] Test responsiveness on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- [ ] Run performance tests to ensure fast load times.
- [ ] Validate cross-browser compatibility.

## Phase 8: Deployment
- [ ] Set up a GitHub repository for the website code.
- [ ] Deploy using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or another platform.
